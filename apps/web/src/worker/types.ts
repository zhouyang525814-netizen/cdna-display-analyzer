//   - Everything must be structurally cloneable (no functions, no class
//     instances with methods — File / Uint8Array / plain objects only).
//   - Maps come back from the pipeline; we flatten them to plain records
//     before crossing so the main thread doesn't need to know about the
//     worker-side internal shapes.
