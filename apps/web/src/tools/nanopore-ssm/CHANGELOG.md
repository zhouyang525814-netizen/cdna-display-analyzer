# Nanopore SSM tool — changelog

All material changes (features, fixes, refactors, design decisions) to the
Nanopore SSM tool land here in reverse-chronological order. Bumped on every
update, including small fixes. References the broader plan in
[/.claude/plans/this-is-the-code-deep-sun.md] under "Phase 6".

## 2026-06-01 — Phase 6.11 — Remove unreliable "Adaptive" toggle (cDNA tool)

User reported that unchecking the "Adaptive: allow length variation
(in-frame indels)" toggle in the cDNA Configure step produced a "disaster"
on a real per-round run — yield collapsed, `discard_length_indel` spiked.

Root cause: the non-adaptive code path runs an **exact 10-bp Rv-anchor
scan** over the read tail, searching from `bestFwEndIdx` forward, and drops
the read whenever the anchor is found *anywhere* before `cdsEndAbs`. Two
compounding flaws:

1. **Positional-blind search.** `indexOfBytes` returns the first occurrence
   of the 10-mer anywhere after the Fw anchor, not the match at the
   expected post-ROI position. For a 69-bp ROI that's 60 candidate windows.
   A random match probability of ~6×10⁻⁵ per read sounds tiny, but real
   libraries are not random — short repeats, AT-biased linkers, or any
   incidental homology between the Rv primer's RC prefix and the ROI
   itself drives the false-positive rate to near 100%, dropping nearly
   every read.
2. **Exact match punishes clean reads.** A single sequencing sub in the
   anchor returns `rvIdx = -1`, which makes the check pass (skip). So
   high-quality reads receive the strict gate; noisy reads silently
   bypass it. Exactly backwards from what the user wants.

The check was also redundant: SSM/cDNA-display variable regions are
substitution-only by design, and the engine's frameshift check is computed
on the *configured* `cdsEnd − cdsStart + 1` length, not the observed read
content, so it can't detect per-read indels regardless.

**Action:**
- Removed the "Adaptive" toggle from `cdna-display/steps/ConfigureStep`.
- Hardcoded `adaptive: true` in `cdna-display/steps/RunStep` so the engine
  always skips the brittle path.
- Left the `adaptive` field on the engine settings and on the store — the
  desktop-Python parity test exercises both branches and we don't want to
  break that contract. The dispatcher just never sends `false` from the
  web UI again.

The Nanopore tool is unaffected (its dual-anchor scorer uses banded
alignment, not exact match).

## 2026-06-01 — Phase 6.10 — Lift CSV size ceiling (multi-GB FASTQ support)

User reported `ERROR: Invalid string length` on a per-round NGS run with two
FASTQs each > 5 GB. Root cause: the analyzer's `serializeCsv` joined every
row into one JS String via `lines.join("\n")`, which trips V8's hard
`~537 MB` single-string-length ceiling once the unique-peptide set is large
enough. A second copy of the same hazard sat in the cDNA Results dashboard,
where `csvBlob.text()` would have re-allocated the whole CSV as one string
even if the writer had succeeded.

Both pipelines (NGS + Nanopore) are now safe to multi-GB CSV output:

- **Writer**: `serializeCsv` returns `string[]` (one `"\n"`-terminated entry
  per line). `AnalyzerOutput.csv: string` → `csvParts: string[]`;
  `NanoporeAnalyzerOutput.perSiteCsv` / `haplotypeCsv` → `…CsvParts:
  string[]`. The worker now constructs Blobs via `new Blob(parts, …)` —
  Blob accepts a list of strings without concatenating them, so the bytes
  live in Blob-managed memory and never form one giant JS String.
- **Reader (cDNA dashboard)**: replaced `outcome.csvBlob.text()` with a new
  `streamParseEnrichmentBlob(blob, opts)` in `viz/csvParse.ts`. Uses
  `blob.stream()` + an incremental `TextDecoder`, processes records line-by-
  line with a carry buffer for partial-line bytes at chunk boundaries, and
  fills the top-N preview, capped matrix (50k rows), and full per-round
  count arrays in a single pass. The Nanopore Results dashboard only
  downloads its Blobs — no streaming change needed there.
- **Tests**: parity, analyzer, nanopore-analyzer, nanopore-2site, and the
  apps/web LocalFastqSource parity test all updated to use
  `parts.join("")` for byte-equality assertions on the 1k-read fixture.
  124 core tests + 7 web tests pass; the web build is green.

This removes the file-size cap entirely — the practical ceiling is now
overall heap pressure from the `dna_counters` Map, not the CSV writer.

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.9 — UX polish batch (typo / layout / tutorial)

Round of feedback from the deployed app. All 8 user-reported items addressed:

1. **Header tool name**: cDNA tool's `shortName` flipped from `cDNA-display`
   to `NGS` so the upper-right pill switcher reads `NGS` ⇄ `Nanopore`
   (platform-level distinction, parallel labels).
2. **Default project name**: both tools' stores now initialise
   `projectName: ""` so the placeholder `e.g. ...` is visible until the user
   types. (Was `"Unnamed_Project"` for cDNA.)
3. **UI width unification**: every Nanopore step's root `<div>` now uses
   `mx-auto max-w-4xl space-y-6`, matching the cDNA tool's container width
   exactly. The two tools now line up across the wizard.
4. **Logo → first step**: the upper-left icon + title are now a button.
   Reads `tool.useSetStep()` and jumps to `tool.steps[0].id`. Doesn't reset
   data; just navigates. Has a subtle hover scale + bg-muted background.
5. **NGS QC threshold**: `minMeanPhred` + `minMeanPhredCds` are now in
   `useRunStore` (default 20.0) and exposed as inputs in the cDNA Configure
   step's "Filters & settings" card. The RunStep dispatcher reads from the
   store instead of hardcoding 20.0.
6. **Site visualisation**: Nanopore Configure now shows a live assembly
   preview per site:
   - Per anchor ≥10 bp typed: a pairing-hint row indicating where the
     anchor matches in the reference (or that it doesn't).
   - For a fully aligned site: an `AssemblyBox` with the extracted ROI
     DNA + translated AA on top, plus 6 bp of flanking context. Lets the
     user see the codon they're about to count without leaving Configure.
7. **Tutorial mode for both tools**:
   - cDNA's existing "Try with demo data" button now stays on Sources
     (instead of jumping to Run) and lights up the prefilled card with a
     primary ring for 8s. Walk-through path: Sources → Configure → Preview
     → Run, with the user clicking through to see the data at each step.
   - Nanopore got a matching button + 1-site demo loader. New file
     [demo.ts](demo.ts) fetches the 3 round FASTQs from `/sample-data/`
     and pre-fills `sites[]`, `rounds[]`, `reference`, `projectName`.
   - Bundled FASTQs copied into `apps/web/public/sample-data/` (was only
     the cDNA's `sample_1k.fastq` before).
8. **CDS AA preview in NGS** + **ROI AA preview in Nanopore**:
   - NGS PreviewStep: new `CdsAaPreview` panel shows DNA + translated AA
     for the selected CDS region, with stop-codon warning when applicable.
   - Nanopore Configure: the new `AssemblyBox` already includes the
     translated AA over the ROI codons.

Engine + tests untouched. Builds: 1,184 KB JS / 263 KB gz (+15 KB / +3 KB gz
for the new UI features). Core tests still 124 passing.

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.8 — Fix: Drive sign-in in per-round mode + Cancel button

User-reported issues from the first browser test.

### Drive picker on per-round Configure was unreachable

- Symptom: in per-round mode, the "Pick from Drive…" button on each round's
  picker was permanently disabled.
- Root cause: the Sources step's MultiplexSources card (which carried the
  Drive sign-in path) is hidden in per-round mode, so the user had no way
  to authenticate. The Configure-side per-round picker requires a cached
  token in sessionStorage; with no path to sign in, the token was never
  cached, so `isDriveSignedIn()` stayed false and the button stayed disabled.
- Fix: added a standalone **DriveSignInCard** to the Sources step that's
  visible whenever Drive is configured AND pipeline mode is per-round.
  Shows a "Connected" badge once signed in (refreshes every 1s so the
  post-OAuth-return state flips automatically); offers a "Sign in to Google
  Drive" button that triggers the OAuth redirect when not signed in; and a
  Sign-out option when connected. With this card, the per-round Configure
  Drive picker now works as expected.
- File: [steps/SourcesStep.tsx](steps/SourcesStep.tsx).

### Cancel button on the Run step

- Mirrors the cDNA tool's pattern: `terminateWorker()` + status="cancelled"
  + warning log entry. The catch arm of `handleStart` now checks the current
  status before promoting Comlink's "worker terminated" rejection into an
  error — cancellation stays surfaced as `cancelled`, not error.
- The Start button now toggles to a destructive Cancel button while
  `status === "running"`.
- A new worker is spawned automatically on the next Start (the
  workerClient lazily reinstantiates after `terminateWorker()`).
- File: [steps/RunStep.tsx](steps/RunStep.tsx).

Both changes are UI-only; no engine touches, no test regressions
(124 passing, 2 skipped).

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.7 — 2-site fixture + smoke test + user configs

The haplotype path now has end-to-end test coverage on a synthetic library
that exercises real epistasis. The 1-site fixture from Phase 6.1 stays
untouched; the new 2-site fixture is parallel content under
[00_material/test_nanopore_2site/](../../../../../../00_material/test_nanopore_2site/).

- New fixture: 560 bp amplicon with two sites 400 bp apart (mimics
  K417 + E484 saturation studies).
  - Site 1 anchors: `GCAACTGGCTAGAATTCCG` / `GGAAGCTAGCGAATTCAAT`, WT codon GCT (Ala)
  - Site 2 anchors: `TTGACTGCATCGATATCC` / `AAGCAGGAATTCGCTAGC`, WT codon TAC (Tyr)
  - 3 rounds, 1000 reads total. Round_2 designed with strong **epistasis**:
    TGG_CTG (W_L double mutant) is 220 reads, far above what marginal
    site frequencies would predict.
  - Bad-read recipe includes `site2_missing` (truncated reads where only
    site_1 succeeds — validates partial-success not counting in haplotype)
    and `stop_in_roi1` (stop at site_1, fine at site_2 — same partial path).
- New test [/web/packages/core/test/nanopore-2site.test.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/test/nanopore-2site.test.ts):
  - Per-site `passed_qc` ≥ 80 % of design for BOTH sites in every round.
  - Haplotype counter populated in every round.
  - Round_2 top haplotype is `TGG_CTG`, ≥ 80 % of designed 220.
  - `haplotype_passed_qc` ≤ min(per-site passed_qc) in every round
    (validates partial-success reads don't sneak into the haplotype).
  - Top haplotype row by `Fitness_vs_WT_Round_2` is **W_L** — the
    epistasis signal the user is looking for.
- New user-facing config files (testing data for the deployed app):
  - [/00_material/test_nanopore/nanopore_config.yaml](../../../../../../00_material/test_nanopore/nanopore_config.yaml)
    + matching `.json` — paste-ready values for the 1-site fixture.
  - [/00_material/test_nanopore_2site/nanopore_config.yaml](../../../../../../00_material/test_nanopore_2site/nanopore_config.yaml)
    + matching `.json` — paste-ready values for the 2-site epistasis fixture.
  - Both include `expected_top_variants` / `expected_top_haplotypes`
    blocks so the user can sanity-check the run output without running the
    Python reference.
- Tests: 124 passing (+1 new), 2 skipped (bench), 0 failing. Core +
  web builds green.

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.6 — Wired Nanopore UI to the real engine

The Start button now actually runs. Mockup placeholders on Run + Results are
gone; both steps render real data from `runNanoporeInWorker`.

- [/web/apps/web/src/state/useNanoporeStore.ts](../../../../state/useNanoporeStore.ts):
  - Added run-state slice mirroring the cDNA store: `status`, `progress`,
    `perSourceBytes`, `startedAt`/`finishedAt`, `log[]`, `outcome`,
    `errorMessage`, plus `resetRun()` and granular setters.
  - `status` type: `"idle" | "running" | "done" | "error" | "cancelled"`.
- [/web/apps/web/src/tools/nanopore-ssm/steps/RunStep.tsx](steps/RunStep.tsx) (full rewrite):
  - Start button builds a `NanoporeJob` from the store, dispatches via
    `runNanoporeInWorker`, and registers a progress callback that fans out
    to `setProgress` + `setSourceBytes`.
  - Per-source progress bars driven by `perSourceBytes / totalBytes` per
    source (works for both local and Drive sources because the orchestrator
    fires progress events with byte counters).
  - Live log panel: `[HH:MM:SS] {msg}` with `info / success / warning / error`
    coloring (semantic colors stay shared with cDNA so meanings line up).
  - On success: outcome stored, transitions straight to Results step.
  - On Drive-token refresh failure: logged + status="error" without throwing.
  - Cancel + wake-lock deferred (cDNA has both; will copy the pattern next).
- [/web/apps/web/src/tools/nanopore-ssm/steps/ResultsStep.tsx](steps/ResultsStep.tsx) (full rewrite):
  - 4 stat cards: Passed QC (all sites), WT-baseline reads, Sites,
    Unique variants (top 200/site).
  - Per-round yield table — one row per round, columns = each site's
    passed_qc + each site's wt_count + (when ≥2 sites) haplotype_passed_qc.
  - Variant tables tabbed per site (top 50 from the 200-row preview),
    sorted by Fitness_vs_WT of the last round. WT badge on rows whose
    `Dominant_DNA` matches the resolved WT.
  - Haplotype tab when ≥2 sites enabled linkage tracking.
  - Download buttons emit `<projectName>__enrichment_per_site.csv` and
    `<projectName>__enrichment_haplotype.csv` Blobs from the outcome.
  - "New run" resets run state + jumps back to Sources.
- Removed unused [/web/apps/web/src/tools/nanopore-ssm/steps/_mockup.tsx](steps/_mockup.tsx)
  (the "UI preview, inputs inert" banner — Run/Results are now wired so it
  doesn't belong; the placeholder still appears via doc-comments only).
- Builds: 1,169 KB JS / 261 KB gz (+4 KB / +2 KB gz vs pre-wire). Worker
  bundle grew 40 KB → 68 KB (the engine + analyzer compiled in once,
  shared with all future runs).
- Core tests still 123 passing.

### What still needs polish
- No Cancel button yet — Start is fire-and-forget until the run finishes
  (matches Phase 4 cDNA behaviour at first; copying the AbortController +
  `terminateWorker()` pattern is a follow-up).
- Wake Lock on running tab: missing.
- Real-data smoke test against the 1k fixture in the actual browser worker
  (vs the Node-side test in Phase 6.3) is Phase 6.7.

Next: Phase 6.7 — extend the test fixture to a 2-site scenario (validates the
haplotype path end-to-end on real-ish data), then run the user-supplied
Nanopore FASTQs through the deployed app.

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.5 — Worker routing: `runNanopore` sibling method

The existing Comlink worker exposed one `run` method (cDNA). I added a sibling
`runNanopore` rather than discriminating one entry-point on a `tool` field —
simpler to read, no risk of breaking the cDNA call site, and a third tool
later just adds another method.

- [/web/apps/web/src/worker/types.ts](../../../../worker/types.ts):
  - New wire types: `NanoporeSiteWire`, `NanoporeRoundWire`, `NanoporeJob`,
    `NanoporeOutcome`. The job carries anchors as plain strings (engine
    encodes them) + a `Partial<NanoporeSettings>` override block; the outcome
    flattens engine Maps to records + wraps both CSVs as Blobs so postMessage
    crosses by reference, not by deep-copy.
  - `NanoporeOutcome` ships a `perSiteRowsPreview` (first 200 rows) for
    instant top-N display in the UI without re-parsing the CSV. Same idea
    for `haplotypeRowsPreview`.
  - `resolvedWtBySite` + `expectedRoiLenBySite` surfaced so the Results UI
    can badge WT rows and show "expected ROI length per site = N bp".
- [/web/apps/web/src/worker/pipeline.worker.ts](../../../../worker/pipeline.worker.ts):
  - Added `runNanopore(job, onProgress)`. Same boundary semantics as `run`:
    constructs `LocalFastqSource` / `DriveFastqSource` worker-side, wraps
    the Nanopore progress callback to add `fileName`, routes through
    `runNanoporePipeline`. Catches + logs exceptions with full stack so a
    stuck job is obvious in DevTools.
- [/web/apps/web/src/worker/workerClient.ts](../../../../worker/workerClient.ts):
  - Added `runNanoporeInWorker(job, onProgress)` — main-thread façade.
    Reuses the single persistent worker instance + the same __ready
    handshake the cDNA path uses.
- Both builds clean: `@cdna/core` + `@cdna/web` (1,165 KB JS / 259 KB gz —
  marginal increase for the new types and the second method).
- Existing tests still 123 passing; no new worker-level tests yet (Comlink
  RPC needs a real Worker which vitest can't host without browser-mode).
  The orchestrator tests in core cover everything the worker delegates to.
- Next: Phase 6.6 — wire the Nanopore Run/Results UI steps to call
  `runNanoporeInWorker`, show progress, render the per-site + haplotype
  results, and offer the CSV downloads.

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.4 — NanoporeAnalyzer with per-site + linked-haplotype CSVs

Final algorithm-side piece. The analyzer turns the engine's per-site DNA
counters + haplotype counters into two CSVs that the UI / exporter will
hand the user.

- New [/web/packages/core/src/nanopore-analyzer.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/src/nanopore-analyzer.ts):
  - `runNanoporeAnalyzer(input)` — one call, two outputs.
  - **Per-site CSV** (`enrichment_per_site.csv`, long format): one row per
    `(site, AA-variant)`, columns: `Site, Variant_AA, Dominant_DNA,
    GC_Percent, Count_<round>, RPM_<round>, Rank_<round>,
    Enrich_Global_<round>, Fitness_vs_WT_<round>`.
  - **Haplotype CSV** (`enrichment_haplotype.csv`, only when ≥2 sites +
    `emitHaplotype` was on): one row per joined-codon haplotype
    (`Haplotype_AA = "A_W"`, `Haplotype_DNA = "GCT_TGG"`), with the same
    metric columns.
  - Math:
    - `RPM = (count / passed_qc[round][site]) × 1e6`
    - `Enrich_Global_<round> = log2((RPM_round + 1) / (RPM_round_0 + 1))`
    - `Fitness_vs_WT_<round> = log2( ((c + 1)/(wt + 1)) / ((c_0 + 1)/(wt_0 + 1)) )`
      — DiMSum/Enrich2 convention with pseudocount 1.0 on every term so the
      formula is defined when a variant or WT has zero reads in any round.
  - Sort: by `Fitness_vs_WT_<lastRound>` desc, with `Variant_AA` asc tiebreaker.
  - Per-site WT counter is derived from `dnaCounters[round][site][wtDna]`,
    not from `stats.sites[site].wt_count` — the latter is only used by
    consumers that want a pre-computed total. The analyzer needs the
    per-round value so it can drive the round-by-round Fitness_vs_WT math.
  - Reuses the cDNA analyzer's `serializeCsv` + `ColumnSpec` types so both
    tools emit pandas-to_csv-compatible output (no trailing zero on
    integer floats, `True`/`False` for bools, sort-keys-style header).
- Wired into `runNanoporePipeline` so callers receive `result.analyzer`
  alongside the raw counters. The worker can ship just the analyzer payload
  to the main thread without recomputing.
- New tests [/web/packages/core/test/nanopore-analyzer.test.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/test/nanopore-analyzer.test.ts):
  - Single-site / single-round: emits one row per AA with correct RPM,
    rank, zero self-enrichment, zero WT-self-fitness.
  - Single-site / single-round with `emitHaplotype=true`: still emits no
    haplotype rows (gated on ≥2 sites).
  - Two-round / single-site: hand-computed `Fitness_vs_WT` matches the
    log2 expression to 1e-9; sort places enriched variant first.
  - Two-site / single-round: rows correctly partitioned per site; RPM
    denominators are per-site.
  - Two-site / two-round / haplotype: enriched double-mutant `W_L` ranks
    first with hand-computed `Fitness_vs_WT_R1` to 1e-9; WT haplotype
    `A_Y` has zero self-fitness.
  - CSV header validates exact column order.
- New public exports from `@cdna/core`: `runNanoporeAnalyzer`,
  `NanoporeAnalyzerInput`, `NanoporeAnalyzerOutput`, `NanoporeAnalyzerRow`.
- Test totals: 123 passing (+6 new), 2 skipped (bench), 0 failing.
- Next: Phase 6.5 — worker discriminated union to route either `runPipeline`
  (cDNA) or `runNanoporePipeline` (Nanopore) based on a `tool` field on the
  job payload.

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.3 — NanoporeEngine + runNanoporePipeline + tests

End-to-end algorithm assembly. The engine ties the dual-anchor scorer to the
per-read QC funnel and the per-site / haplotype counters; the orchestrator
mirrors `runPipeline` for cDNA (source-streaming, scratch-buffer reuse, RC
retry on no-site-extracted, progress callback).

- New [/web/packages/core/src/nanopore.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/src/nanopore.ts):
  - `NanoporeEngine` — per-read state machine. Per-call entry points are
    `processRead(seq, qual)` (multiplexed: barcode-match → bind to round)
    and `processReadForRound(seq, qual, idx)` (per-round: bound by caller).
  - Per-read funnel: read-Q gate → barcode match (multiplexed only) → for
    each site `{ scorer.score → ROI length check → ROI Q check → frameshift
    → stop }` → commit to `dnaCounters[round][site]` + `wt_count` if WT
    match → haplotype counter when all sites pass + reportHaplotype.
  - `createTsScorer(sites, settings)` — pure-TS fallback that calls
    `bandedAlign` twice per site. Same byte-output as the WASM scorer
    (parity-tested in Phase 6.2b).
  - `resolveWtRois(reference, sites)` — exact-match anchor scan over the
    user's reference to derive WT ROI + expected ROI length per site.
    Thrown errors are caught by the orchestrator.
  - `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` — SUP-R10.4 baseline: read Q ≥10, ROI Q ≥15,
    maxSubs=2, maxIndels=1, filterStop=true, reportHaplotype=true.
- New [/web/packages/core/src/nanopore-pipeline.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/src/nanopore-pipeline.ts):
  - `runNanoporePipeline(req)` — accepts `IFastqSource[]` + sites + rounds +
    reference + settings. Returns per-site dna counters, haplotype counters,
    per-round stats, and resolved site configs (for downstream analyzer).
  - Streams each source via the existing `readFastqRecords` async iterator;
    reuses `uppercaseInto` / `rcInto` / `reverseInto` / `copyInto` scratch
    buffers from the cDNA pipeline (same allocation pattern, no copy on
    fwd path).
  - RC retry fires only on outcomes `!== "assigned"` and `!== "low_quality_read"`
    — low-Q is a chemistry property, RC can't fix it.
  - Progress callback identical to `PipelineProgress` shape so the worker /
    UI can plug in unchanged.
  - WASM scorer used when `useWasm: true`; pure-TS fallback otherwise. Both
    paths are byte-identical (covered by the Phase 6.2b parity suite).
- Engine refactor: dropped per-round `total_reads` and `passed_read_q`
  counters. They were prone to RC-retry double-counting and the analyzer
  uses per-site `passed_qc` as its RPM denominator anyway. Mirrors how the
  cDNA `RoundStats` shape works (no `total_reads`; `total_assigned` only
  increments on successful binding).
- New tests:
  - [/web/packages/core/test/nanopore.test.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/test/nanopore.test.ts) — 14 engine
    unit tests covering happy path (WT vs variant; aggregation), every
    discard bucket (read-Q, no-anchor, ROI-indel, ROI-low-Q, stop codon),
    multiplexed barcode binding (assigned / mismatch / ambiguous tie), and
    multi-site haplotype emission (all-pass emits, partial-pass skips,
    reportHaplotype=false disables).
  - [/web/packages/core/test/nanopore-pipeline.test.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/test/nanopore-pipeline.test.ts)
    — end-to-end against the 1k-read fixture in
    [00_material/test_nanopore/](../../../../../../00_material/test_nanopore/).
    Asserts per-round passed_qc within 85 % of design target (loss is real:
    flank noise occasionally piles up inside the 3-edit anchor budget),
    asserts bad-read buckets fire at least the seeded count (they catch
    extra anchor-boundary-slip reads in addition to the seeded indels),
    asserts Round_2 top variant is TGG with the right magnitude.
- Test totals: 117 passing (+15 new), 2 skipped (bench), 0 failing.

### Algorithm note: anchor-boundary slip

When a Nanopore indel lands inside an anchor, the banded matcher returns a
match position that's shifted by 1 bp; the engine extracts a ROI that's
1 bp longer or shorter than expected, which is then rejected as
`discard_roi_indel`. This is structurally bounded — `maxIndels=1` per
anchor means at most 1 bp of slip per side per read — but it does mean
the per-site `discard_roi_indel` counter is an UPPER bound on
true-indel-in-ROI reads, not a precise count. A more precise approach
(anchor the match's END position rather than minimize edit distance)
would tighten this; deferred.

### Public surface

`@cdna/core` now exports:
- `bandedAlign`, `bandedAlignAscii`, `BandedAlignResult`
- `NanoporeEngine`, `NANOPORE_DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, `createTsScorer`, `resolveWtRois`
- All Nanopore types: `NanoporeSiteConfig`, `NanoporeRoundConfig`,
  `NanoporeSettings`, `NanoporeSiteStats`, `NanoporeRoundStats`,
  `NanoporeGlobalBreakdown`, `NanoporeOutcome`, `SiteScorerLike`,
  `DualAnchorSiteOutput`
- `runNanoporePipeline`, `NanoporePipelineRequest`, `NanoporePipelineProgress`,
  `NanoporePipelineResult`, `NanoporeSiteInput`, `NanoporeRoundInput`

Next: Phase 6.4 — `NanoporeAnalyzer` (per-site CSV + linked-haplotype CSV +
`Fitness_vs_WT_*` columns), then Phase 6.5 (worker discriminated union to
dispatch jobs to either pipeline).

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.2b — Rust port of banded alignment + DualAnchorScorer

Hot path lands in the WASM crate. The TS reference impl stays in place for
the Node-side test suite and as a fallback for environments without WASM;
both produce byte-identical results.

- Rust additions in [/web/packages/core-wasm/src/lib.rs](../../../../../../web/packages/core-wasm/src/lib.rs):
  - `banded_align(haystack, needle, max_subs, max_indels) → Option<MatchResult>`
    — port of the TS algorithm with identical tie-breaking semantics.
  - `limited_edit_distance` — Wagner-Fischer DP with row rolling + early
    termination at `tolerance = max_subs + max_indels`.
  - `bandedAlign` (free function, `#[wasm_bindgen]`) — returns a 4-element
    `Float64Array` `[found, start, end, score]`. Used by the parity test.
  - `DualAnchorScorer` struct exposing `addSite(fw, rv)`, `resultView()`,
    `score(seq)`. Per-site result layout: 5 `f64` slots per site —
    `[found, fwStart, fwEnd, rvStart, rvEnd]`. One WASM boundary crossing
    per read regardless of site count.
  - Downstream anchor is searched only from `fw_end` onward — the engine
    can't accidentally pair the upstream anchor with a downstream match
    that's actually before it.
- TS façade additions in [/web/packages/core/src/wasm.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/src/wasm.ts):
  - `createDualAnchorScorer(sites, maxSubs, maxIndels)` → `DualAnchorScorerLike`
  - `wasmBandedAlign(haystack, needle, maxSubs, maxIndels)` — one-shot wrapper
  - Both reuse the existing `resultView()`-aliasing trick (no per-call copy).
- Parity test [/web/packages/core/test/banded-align-parity.test.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/test/banded-align-parity.test.ts):
  - 10 fixed cases (exact match, sub/indel, edge cases) running both impls
    and asserting identical `{found, start, end, score}`.
  - 1 fuzz suite of 200 random anchor/haystack pairs × 5 (sub, indel) budgets
    = 1000 paired evaluations. All match.
- WASM bundle size: 18.4 KB → 23.7 KB (+5.3 KB for both new exports). Web
  build: 1,165 KB JS / 259 KB gz (unchanged — WASM is loaded separately).
- Test results: 101 passing (+11 new), 2 skipped (bench), 0 failing.
- Next: Phase 6.3 — wire `DualAnchorScorer` into a per-read `NanoporeEngine`
  with the QC funnel (read-Q → anchors → ROI-length → ROI-Q → translate →
  count) + the multi-site / haplotype accumulator.

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.2a — Banded approximate string matcher (TS reference impl)

First piece of the dual-anchor extraction engine. Pure-TS approximate string
matcher used to locate each site's upstream + downstream anchor in a Nanopore
read with tolerance for ~5% basecaller error.

- New file: [/web/packages/core/src/banded-align.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/src/banded-align.ts).
  - `bandedAlign(haystack, needle, maxSubs, maxIndels) → BandedAlignResult`
  - Wagner-Fischer DP with row rolling + early row-min termination at
    `tolerance = maxSubs + maxIndels`.
  - Window-length band: alignment span in `[m - maxIndels, m + maxIndels]`,
    so indel count is structurally capped.
  - Returns lowest-score hit; ties break by earliest start, then shortest length.
  - Tie-breaking rationale: prefer compact alignments, deterministic across
    runs, so the engine doesn't flap between equally-scoring placements.
- New test file: [/web/packages/core/test/banded-align.test.ts](../../../../../../web/packages/core/test/banded-align.test.ts)
  with 20 cases covering exact matches, substitutions, indels, combined
  errors, realistic 19-bp Nanopore anchors, edge cases (empty inputs,
  haystack too short, Uint8Array direct).
- `pnpm --filter @cdna/core test` → 90/92 passing (+20 new; 2 are skipped
  benches).
- Next: Rust port of the same algorithm + the `DualAnchorScorer` struct that
  uses it twice per site to locate the inter-anchor ROI (Phase 6.2b).

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.1e — Fix: blank page on Continue (Zustand v5 selector bug)

- Symptom: clicking Continue from Sources → Configure (or any step → step
  transition that mounted Configure/Preview) rendered a blank page.
- Root cause: `findAllSitesInReference` was being passed to
  `useNanoporeStore(...)` as a selector, but it returns a brand-new
  `{ ref, sites, refError, overlapError }` object on every call. Zustand v5
  enforces React 18's `useSyncExternalStore` contract that snapshot identity
  must be stable for unchanged state; an ever-changing snapshot trips the
  "getSnapshot should be cached" detection and React unmounts the tree.
- Fix: refactored `findAllSitesInReference` to a pure function taking
  `(inputSites, referenceSeq)` directly. ConfigureStep + PreviewStep now read
  the two relevant state slices via the store and wrap the call in `useMemo`,
  so the alignment object only recomputes when the inputs actually change.
- Added a docstring warning on the function so the trap isn't repeated.
- Files: [src/state/useNanoporeStore.ts](src/state/useNanoporeStore.ts),
  [steps/ConfigureStep.tsx](steps/ConfigureStep.tsx),
  [steps/PreviewStep.tsx](steps/PreviewStep.tsx).

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.1d — Multi-site redesign

Trigger: user pointed out that Nanopore SSM realistically has two saturated
sites that can sit 100–1000+ bp apart on the same amplicon. The original
"one shared anchor pair, one ROI" model can't represent that.

Changes:
- Store: replaced shared `fwAnchor` / `rvAnchor` (top-level) with
  `sites: NanoporeSite[]`, each holding `{name, fwAnchor, rvAnchor}`. Default
  is 1 site (single-codon SSM); users add more for distant variable positions.
- Store: added `reportHaplotype: boolean`, default true. Only meaningful when
  ≥2 sites are configured.
- Store: replaced `findAnchorsInReference` (single-site) with
  `findAllSitesInReference` (per-site + overlap check). Each site's anchors
  must be locatable in the reference, in order; sites cannot overlap.
- Configure step: "Shared anchors" card replaced with **Variable sites**
  card. Each site is a card-within-card with name + fw/rv anchor inputs +
  live ROI-length feedback derived from the reference.
- Configure step: new **Output** card with two rows:
  - "Per-site enrichment" — always emitted
  - "Linked haplotype counts" — checkbox, auto-gated by `sites.length >= 2`,
    with `needs ≥2 sites` badge until then.
- Preview step: numbered marker line above the reference ruler so multi-site
  cases are visually trackable. Each site's anchors paint primary, each ROI
  paints success. Per-site status grid below the ruler (green check / amber
  warn). Continue gated on all-sites-aligned + no-overlap.
- Run step: summary line shows `N sites + haplotype` when applicable.
- Results step: per-round yield table grew a "passed per site" column per
  site; variant tables became tabbed (one tab per site, plus a `haplotype`
  tab when ≥2 sites enable linkage).
- Plan file: Phase 6.4 analyzer scope updated to emit two CSV families:
  `enrichment_per_site.csv` (long format) + `enrichment_haplotype.csv`
  (joined-codon haplotypes, only when all sites extract from same read).
  Stats schema bumped to `schema_version: 2` with `sites.{site}.{counter}`
  nested per round.

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.1c — Wire real state into UI

- Replaced mockup placeholders with real state-backed inputs across all 5
  steps (Sources, Configure, Preview, Run; Results stays placeholder until
  the engine ships).
- Multiplexed mode wires shared local + Drive FASTQ picker (drag-drop,
  multi-select, file warnings). Per-round mode wires per-round file picker
  on Configure (local + Drive, sign-in via Sources).
- Per-round form: name + (multiplexed) barcode 3–12 bp prefix + (per-round)
  FASTQ file/Drive ref.
- Continue / Back wired to `goNext` / `goPrev`. Each step has validation
  selectors that disable Continue when the form is incomplete:
  - Sources: project name required; multiplexed also requires ≥1 file
  - Configure: reference ≥30 bp; both anchors ≥12 bp; all rounds named; all
    rounds have barcode (multiplexed) or file (per-round); unique barcodes
- Advanced QC defaults baked in: read Q≥10, ROI Q≥15 (SUP R10.4 baseline).
- Extracted `isDriveSignedIn()` into [adapters/DriveAuthProvider.ts](../../../adapters/DriveAuthProvider.ts)
  as a shared export so both tools use the same Drive token check.

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.1b — 5-step pseudo UI skeleton

- Built `SourcesStep`, `ConfigureStep`, `PreviewStep`, `RunStep`,
  `ResultsStep` as visual mockups mirroring the cDNA tool's layout. Lots of
  primary-tinted elements per step so the indigo theme is unmistakable when
  the user clicks the Nanopore pill in the header.
- Added `useNanoporeStore.ts` with step navigation (`currentStep`, `goNext`,
  `goPrev`, `setStep`).
- Removed the old single-step `ComingSoonStep`; the tool now exposes 5 step
  ids (sources / configure / preview / run / results).
- Shared "UI preview — inputs inert" banner so it's clear nothing was wired
  yet at this stage.

## 2026-05-30 — Phase 6.1 — Per-tool theming infrastructure

- Added `:root[data-tool="nanopore-ssm"]` CSS variable override in
  [src/index.css](../../../index.css): primary + ring + secondary + accent
  flip to indigo (`hsl(243 75% 59%)`); semantic colors (success / warning /
  destructive) stay shared with cDNA so a yellow warning means the same thing
  in both tools.
- App.tsx mirrors `activeToolId` onto `<html data-tool="...">` via a
  `useEffect`, so all charts/UI auto-pick the per-tool palette.
- Refactored `RankAbundance.tsx` (cDNA viz) to source `PALETTE[0]` from
  `hsl(var(--primary))` so the first-round line follows the active theme.
- Created the test fixture at [00_material/test_nanopore/](../../../../../../00_material/test_nanopore/)
  with a seeded generator (1k reads across 3 rounds + ground-truth metadata
  + intentional bad-read mix across 9 failure modes).
